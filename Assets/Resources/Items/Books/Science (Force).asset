  text: "It has been long apparent to the old ones that rules govern the universe.
    Similarities can be drawn between our ancestor\u2019s home world and the one
    we occupy today. Should we drop a fleshberry, will it not fall? Pre-event accounts
    tell of a man sitting in the shade of a tree, before a fruit falls from above,
    striking his head. At this moment, it is believed humanities most significant
    epiphany occurred --things fall when you let go of them.\r\n\r\nGravity as it
    was to be named, make one of many so called 'Forces'. A force is merely a non-magical
    law that when combined with others form the world around us. Rub two sticks together
    and you create heat, that would be friction. Put a chicken between two boulders
    and the chicken is destroyed, we call this force crushing. But why should we
    care about these forces?\r\n\r\nUnlike our fortunate elvish comrades, we're not
    gifted with magical ability, nor do we possess extensive physical prowess like
    the orcs. What do humans have that they do not? Sience. Collective study of non-magical
    laws can be a powerful tool when utilized and the study of force is an important
    foundation in which all other laws follow."
